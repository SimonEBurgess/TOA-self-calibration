TOA-self-calibration
====================

Time Of Arrival (TOA) self-calibration code, focusing of the case where either receivers or transmitters are in a lower dimensional subspace, e.g. receivers are in 2D and transmitters in 3D.

The code is based on the journal paper "Simon Burgess, Yubin Kuang, Kalle Åström, TOA sensor network self-calibration for receiver and transmitter spaces with difference in dimension, Signal Processing (2014), 10.1016/j.sigpro.2014.05.034".

All code and data can be used free of charge for academic research, provided that you cite the mentioned paper.
